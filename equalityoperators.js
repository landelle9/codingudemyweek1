//Equality operators will return a true or false value - boolean value. In this case, true will be the only result. This is because the constant is 18, so if the age is not equivalent to 18 the result will come back as false. ' ==== ' - strict equality operator, only returns true when both values are the same and has type coercion. '==' loose equality operator, there is no type coercion. so '18' == 18 will still come back as true.

// Always use strict operators.
